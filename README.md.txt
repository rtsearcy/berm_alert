# berm_alert

## Overview: A CV classifier that can indicate if a coastal stream is bermed (i.e. a lagoon has formed) or is open to the sea

## Motivation:
- Fish passage: berms control when anadromous fish such as salmon and steelhead can migrate to and from the ocean
- Water quality: Contamination can build up in bermed lagoons. When the berm is breached, that contamination is released to the nearshore environment, impacting water quality for beachgoers and nearshore ecosystems
- Surf quality/Sediment transport: Streams transfer sediment from higher in a watershed out to the coast. This has impacts on beach morphology (i.e. is there sand on the beach?) and nearshore sandbars, which impact wave quality for surfers.

## Methods:
- TBD
